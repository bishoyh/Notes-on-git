# Notes on Git adapted from like-on-git
> Takes notes while save links to your git rep
> Chrome extension to save links that you like on Github repository that you specify

It makes it seem-less to create "today-i-read" repository where you put all the links that you read or liked. Just click a button and the link will be committed to your repository under the current date.

## Installation

- Install it from the chrome webstore by following the URL: https://goo.gl/Wj595G
- Or download the extension and [load it manually](http://superuser.com/questions/247651/how-does-one-install-an-extension-for-chrome-browser-from-the-local-file-system/247654#247654)

## Setup

- First things first, create a repository to which you would want the links to the liked content be added
- Now add a file e.g. README.md. This is the file that will be holding your likes and you'll have to provide it while setting up the options in the step below.
- Right click the extension icon (thumb icon) in the bar and click the options page
- At the options page, add the specified details
